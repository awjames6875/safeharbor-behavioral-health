# Status - Quick Project Overview

Read memory-bank files and provide a quick snapshot of project status, priorities, and blockers.

## Instructions

1. Read these memory-bank files:
   - `projectbrief.md` - For project overview
   - `activeContext.md` - For current work
   - `progress.md` - For todo status and launch readiness

2. Provide a QUICK STATUS REPORT (keep it concise, ~10 lines):

   **Project:** SafeHarbor Behavioral Health
   **Launch Readiness:** XX% (SEO XX%, Content XX%, Technical XX%, Conversion XX%, Performance XX%, Compliance XX%)
   **Current Sprint:** [Sprint name from activeContext]
   **In Progress:** [List 2-3 top in-progress items]
   **Next Priority:** [Top backlog item]
   **Blockers:** [Any known blockers, or "None"]
   **Last Updated:** [timestamp from activeContext.md]

3. Optional Extensions:
   - If user wants detailed status, show expanded version with:
     - All in-progress tasks
     - Top 5 backlog items
     - Recent completions
   - Suggest which backlog items are highest priority based on launch readiness gaps
