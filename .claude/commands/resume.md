# Resume Work Session

Read all memory-bank files to understand where I left off, then summarize the current state and ask what I should work on next.

## Instructions

1. Read these files IN THIS ORDER to understand the current state:
   - `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` - Project overview and goals
   - `memory-bank/techContext.md` - Technical stack and architecture
   - `memory-bank/activeContext.md` - What I was working on
   - `memory-bank/progress.md` - Todo list and backlog

2. Provide a SUMMARY that includes:
   - **Last Session:** Brief description of what was worked on
   - **Current Focus:** What's currently in progress (with task names)
   - **Next Priority:** What should happen next (from the todo list)
   - **Blockers:** Any known issues or decisions needed

3. Ask: "Should I continue with [specific next task], or would you prefer to work on something else?"

## Example Summary Format

**Last Session:** "Implemented the Memory Bank system with 4 templates and 6 IDE config files. All files verified as readable."
